# shadPS4-Hyperspin-module
i just created this module for shadPS4 to work in Hyperspin, you will have to set the emulator to always launch in full screen and in RL set the global module settings Fullscreen to always true, also important thing to note, this emulator will not run games unless you have your own PS4 system modules!
